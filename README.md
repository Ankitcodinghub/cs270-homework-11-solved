(a) If Ham-Cycle is polynomial time reducible to interval scheduling problem then

P = NP.

(b) The NP-Hard class of problems does not contain any decision problems.

(c) If there exists an algorithm that solves problem X with pseudo-polynomial runtime, then X must be NP-Hard.

(d) Suppose there is a 7-approxmiation algorithm for the general Traveling Salesman Problem. Then there exists a polynomial time solution for the 3-SAT problem.

(e) A vertex that is part of a minimum vertex cover can never be a part of a maximum independent set.

2. (15pts) Given an undirected graph with positive edge weights, the BIGHAM- CYCLE problem is to decide if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle C such that the sum of weights of edges in C is at least half of the total sum of weights of edges in the graph. Show that finding BIG-HAM-CYCLE in a graph is NP-Complete.

3. (15pts) Given an undirected connected graph G= (V, E) in which a certain number of tokens t(v) = 1 or 2 placed on each vertex v. You will now play the following game. You pick a vertex u that contains at least two tokens, remove two tokens from u and add one token to any one of adjacent vertices. The objective of the game is to perform a sequence of moves such that you are left with exactly one token in the whole graph. You are not allowed to pick a vertex with 0 or 1 token. Prove that the problem of finding such a sequence of moves is NP-Hard by reduction from Hamiltonian Path.

4. (20 pts) In a certain town, there are many clubs, and every adult belongs to at least one club. The townâ€™s people would like to simplify their social life by disbanding as many clubs as possible, but they want to make sure that afterwards everyone will

1

still belong to at least one club. Formally the Redundant Clubs problem has the following input and output. INPUT: List of people; list of clubs; list of members of each club; number K. OUTPUT: Yes if there exists a set of K clubs such that, after disbanding all clubs in this set, each person still belongs to at least one club. No otherwise. Prove that the Redundant Clubs problem is NP -Complete.

5. (15 pts) Given a graph G=(V, E) with an even number of vertices as the input, the

HALF-IS problem is to decide if G has an independent set of size . Prove that HALF-IS is in NP-Complete.
